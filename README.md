## Usage

### Duplicate Issue Finder

To find duplicate issues in a GitHub repository, use the `duplicate_issue_finder.py` script with the repository owner and name as command-line arguments, plus any additional options:

```
python duplicate_issue_finder.py owner repo_name --days 30 --threshold 0.8 --top_n 10
```

### GPT-4 Issue Responder

To generate responses to GitHub issues using OpenAI's GPT-4 model and post them as comments, run the `gpt_issue_responder.py` script with the repository owner and name as command-line arguments:

```
python gpt_issue_responder.py owner repo_name
```

### Software Architecture Generator

To generate a software architecture from a given repository URL, run the `architecture_generator.py` script with the repository URL as an argument:

```
python architecture_generator.py https://github.com/owner/repo_name
```

### README Generator

To generate a README file for a GitHub repository using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model, run the `docs_generator.py` script with the GitHub repository URL as input:

```
python docs_generator.py https://github.com/owner/repo_name
```

### GitHub Repository Information Extractor

To extract information about a GitHub repository using the GitHub API, import and use the functions from `github_info_extractor.py`:

```python
from github_info_extractor import extract_files_from_url, extract_repopath_from_url, get_files_in_repo

files = extract_files_from_url("https://github.com/owner/repo_name")
repo_path = extract_repopath_from_url("https://github.com/owner/repo_name")
all_files = get_files_in_repo(repo_path)
```

### Pull Request Reviewer

To assist with reviewing GitHub pull requests using OpenAI's GPT-4 language model, run the `pr_reviewer.py` script with the pull request URL as an argument:

```
python pr_reviewer.py https://github.com/owner/repo_name/pull/123
```
